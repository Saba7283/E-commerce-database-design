-- 4. Queries using SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING

-- Total customers
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers FROM customers;

-- Average order value
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_order_value FROM orders;

-- Total spent by each customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Orders per customer
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS number_of_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Customers who spent more than â‚¹50000
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 50000;

-- Average product price per category
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- Products sold more than 1 time
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM order_items
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING total_quantity_sold > 1;

-- Top 2 spending customers
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 2;
